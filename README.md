# AdventOfCode2022

My attempt at solving all [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles of 2022 in Python3.
All code for the solutions can be found in the solutions folder.


Remember, not all code is optimized nor the smartest implementation. The code is written to get me to the answer, and not to be optimized for production.

Any library used but not in this list is assumed to be a standard library
